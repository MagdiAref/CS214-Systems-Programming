# Systems-Programming-
List of C projects completed in this course.

Grep.C :
- Write a program that takes a string as a command-line argument and then                                                                                                              
reads from stdin until the user closes stdin (with ctrl-d). It should print                                                                                                            
every line that contains the given string. It should be case-sensitive by                                                                                                              
default, but case-insensitive if the command line option -i is given before                                                                                                            
the string.

Factor.C :
- Write a program that takes a single integer n as a command-line argumentand finds its prime factors, excluding 1.  
The output should consist of a single line listing each prime factor in non-decreasing order, separated by a space. 
If n is prime, just print n itself. If there are repeat factors, print the factor as many times as it divides n. 
You can assume that2≤n≤231−1(i.e.,n will fit in a signed 32-bit integer).
Take an input as the commane line 
    //use argv and atoi to get the input and place into function factor 
creating factor.c 
    // find the prime factors 
    // use math.h to find the dividends 
    // for loop to print out 
output 
    // increasing order such as 13, 17 
    // if n is prime print out n 
    // if factors are repeated then print them out as many times needed // 32 = 2 2 2 2 2
